        <h2>Version 1.1.5</h2>
        <p>
                - Removed "Generator" in the name and replaced it with "Picker". Makes much more sense, really.<br>

                - Changed the header of the page by adding images.<br>
                - Fixed a temporary issue where clicking 'Generate a Random Location' would not work due to a typo.<br>

                - Bumped version from 1.1.0 to 1.1.5.<br>
                - Changed the "View All Locations" output text from Gold to Medium Blue.<br>
                - Added a button which shows the list of available squares in the array.<br>
                - Made other massive improvements.<br>
                </p>
                <hr style = "background-color:red;">
